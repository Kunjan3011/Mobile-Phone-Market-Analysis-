# Mobile Phone Market Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of a mobile phone dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The main objectives are:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To uncover key insights and trends in the mobile phone market by examining distributions, correlations, and relationships between features such as RAM, battery capacity, screen size, and price.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** To improve data quality by handling missing values, addressing outliers, and correcting data type inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Engineering:** To enhance the dataset's predictive power and enable deeper analysis by creating new features like Average Launched Price, Screen Size Numeric, and RAM-Battery Ratio.


## Dataset

The project utilizes the "Mobiles Dataset (2025).csv" file containing information on over 2000 mobile phone models.


## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Importing the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration:** Examining data shape, types, summary statistics, missing values, distributions, correlations, and categorical variable frequencies.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers (using Winsorization), and data type inconsistencies, and addressing categorical data inconsistencies.
4. **Data Wrangling:** Creating new features (Average Launched Price, Screen Size Numeric, RAM-Battery Ratio) and transforming existing ones.
5. **Data Analysis:** Performing descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, group-wise analysis, and investigating relationships between average price and other features.
6. **Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, regression plots) to represent key findings.


## Results

The analysis revealed several key findings, including:

* Strong correlations between certain features, such as RAM and battery capacity.
* Variations in average launched prices across different companies, suggesting brand impact on pricing.
* Relationships between average price and other features, such as RAM, battery capacity, and screen size.


## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the mobile phone market, highlighting key trends and relationships between features. The findings can be used for further analysis, such as building predictive models for mobile phone prices or understanding consumer preferences.


## Usage

To run the analysis, simply open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab and execute the code cells in sequential order. Make sure you have the necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) installed.
